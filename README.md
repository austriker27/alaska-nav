# Alaska Airlines - In Air App Redesign ✈️
This is a redesign of a mock Alaska Airlines app for staff to use while on flights. I rebuilt it from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

## 🚀 Deployment
This project uses continuous deployment via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy from the `master` branch. Check it out [here](https://alaskaair.netlify.com/).

<b>Built in</b>
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML

## Tests
At this time there are no tests. 

## 🎉 Run on your local machine: 
1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm install` from your CLI of choice
3. run `browser-sync start --server --files "css/*.css"` from your CLI and then visit [Localhost](http://localhost:3000/) to see the site in person. 

## 🧐 How to use?

Visit [the website](https://alaskaair.netlify.com/) and browse around the app. It's best viewable on a phone sized screen.

## FUTURE TODO: 
- better icons in the bottom bar
- animated greeting
- make more dry, espcially in DOM manipulation (one example would be writing a function to toggle children in the various menus on click)

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute! Just submit a PR and I'll take a look.
