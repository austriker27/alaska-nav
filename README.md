## Alaska Airlines - In Air App Redesign
This is a redesign of a mock Alaska Airlines app for staff to use while on flights. I rebuilt it from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

## Deployment
This project uses continuous deployment via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploy from the `master` branch. Check it out [here](https://alaskaair.netlify.com/).

## TODO: 

- better icons in the bottom bar
- animated greeting
- make more dry, espcially in DOM manipulation (one example would be writing a function to toggle children in the various menus on click)

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute! Just submit a PR and I'll take a look.
